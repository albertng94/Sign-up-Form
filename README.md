# Sign-up-Form
**Project to create a Sign-up Form (from The Odin Project)**


**About the project:**
This project is the first task in The Odin Project's Full Stack JavaScript course curriculum, and aims to create a desktop-based sign up form inspired by the following one: https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/5f37d43908ef92499e95a9b90fc3cc291a95014c/html_css/project-sign-up-form/sign-up-form.png

It is divided in two parts, the left one consisting of an image and title to present the product, and the right one of some text motivating to create an account followed by the sign-up form. The sign-up form is not meant to be fully functional. It is meant instead to practice the creation, styling, and client-side validation of forms.

**Built with:**
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

**Features:**
- Responsive to different Desktop sizes.
- All form fields are required to submit.
- Form inputs have rules that must be met for the user to submit.
- User has feedback of the rules when completing the form fields.
- User has feedback on filling correctly a form or not through colorus, text, border, and symbols white or red.
- User has feedback after successfully submiting the form.

**Methodology:**
- Used CSS Flexbox for content organization.
- Used relative units to accomplish responsiveness.
- Used pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements for interactive styling.
- Used RegEx alongside the "pattern" attribute to create validation tests for form elements.
- Used a combination of CSS and JavaScript to correctly style the form elements according to their validation status.

**Accomplishments:**
- Learning a lot about form elements, attributes, and related css properties.
- Improving responsiveness through relative units and methods such as calc().
- Using position relative/absolute to position things outside of the general flow.
- Learning about the "generated content" method.
- Perfectioning the use of Event listeners.
- Perfectioning the use of properties to traverse the DOM.
- Learning about getComputedStyle() method.
- Learning about preventDefault() method.
